a. eBGP(Because 3c is gateway router)  
b. iBGP(Because 3a is Internal router)  
c. eBGP(Because 1c is gateway router)  
d. iBGP(Because 1d is Internal router)  

## P15  
a. I1 because I1 begins the least cost path from 1d towards the gateway router 1c.  
b. I2. Both routes have equal AS-PATH length but I2 begins the path that has the closest NEXT-HOP router.
c. I1. The shortest AS-PATH is AS3 AS4 where from I1 can reach.

ISP C advertise that only through the router E it can reach ISP D.

In the above solution, X does not know about the AC link since X does not receive an
advertised route to w or to y that contain the AC link (i.e., X receives no advertisement
containing both AS A and AS C on the path to a destination.

A should advise to B two routes, AS-paths A-W and A-V.(Because both W and V can get the packet from B.)  
A should advise to C only one route, A-V.(Because only V can get the packet from C.)  
C receives AS paths: B-A-W, B-A-V, A-V
